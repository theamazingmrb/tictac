## INTRODUCTION

Tic Tac to has been played for years. This was a simple project to introduce myself to some of the possibilities of coding. This was built in my first week at General Assembly's Web development Immersive class.



## TECHNOLOGY USED

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JQuery



## APPROACH

I started off by making the Game board and all of the boxs. Once I had a grid set up for the game I jumped into the javascript and started the game logic.


## UNSOLVED PROBLEMS/STRETCH GOALS

* I wanted to update the X and the O to have a specific color
* Add in a score board to keep track of score

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

* clone the repository into a local file
* open the index.html file and enjoy

## MVP

* Have a game available to play
* Switch turns from player to player
* Notify the players who has won
